The request quota is calculated for a user of the cluster regardless of the host from which they send these requests. The default quota on requests is 100 RPS. If this limit is reached, requests are queued. The default queue depth is 100 requests. If the queue is full, the user gets the `Request queue size limit exceeded` error when they send another request. {% if audience == "internal" %}You can ask for increasing the limits. To do this, create a ticket in the [st/YTADMINREQ](https://st.yandex-team.ru/YTADMINREQ/new) queue and wait for approval.{% else %}You can ask your cluster administrator to increase the limits.{% endif %}
